    "## Imperfect Translation\n",
    "You might notice that some sentences translate better than others.  Since the dataset you're using only has a vocabulary of 227 English words of the thousands that you use, you're only going to see good results using these words.  Additionally, the translations in this data set were made by Google translate, so the translations themselves aren't particularly good.  (We apologize to the French speakers out there!) Thankfully, for this project, you don't need a perfect translation. However, if you want to create a better translation model, you'll need better data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can train on the [WMT10 French-English corpus](http://www.statmt.org/wmt10/training-giga-fren.tar).  This dataset has more vocabulary and richer in topics discussed.  However, this will take you days to train, so make sure you've a GPU and the neural network is performing well on dataset we provided.  Just make sure you play with the WMT10 corpus after you've submitted this project.\n",
    "## Submitting This Project\n",
    "When submitting this project, make sure to run all the cells before saving the notebook. Save the notebook file as \"dlnd_language_translation.ipynb\" and save it as a HTML file under \"File\" -> \"Download as\". Include the \"helper.py\" and \"problem_unittests.py\" files in your submission."
